# SterileGMP Knowledge Hub — Comprehensive Scope & Roadmap

This document summarizes the current coverage status, gap analysis, and expansion roadmap for building a comprehensive sterile pharmaceutical manufacturing knowledge hub suitable for COO-level operational decision-making.

Last updated: 2026-04-11 — 171 documents complete (PDA 41, USP 76, ISPE 14, FDA 6, ICH 6, PIC/S 4, ISO 17, Ph.Eur. 7); Added 21 CFR Subchapter F Biologics (Parts 600–680): 6 sections, web-sourced from eCFR/LII; Raw PDFs queue: 3 permanently blocked (OCR/encoding); Added 5 new 21 CFR chapter recommendations to roadmap (Parts 11, 210/211, 4, 312, 820)

---

## System Architecture

The hub is designed as a layered knowledge system. Skills (slash commands) read from all layers to produce site-grounded, regulation-backed outputs.

```
Education Layer: Document Discovery & Learning   index.html / learning-path.html / mindmap.html
  Bilingual dashboard, department curriculum,    ← This repo (public)  ✅ COMPLETE
  interactive mind map — powered by reports.json
  + gmp-curriculum-data.js

Layer 1: Regulatory / Technical Reference    knowledge/
  PDA, ISPE, PIC/S, FDA, ICH, USP, ISO      ← This repo (public)  ✅ COMPLETE

Expert Knowledge Base                        knowledge/EXPERT/
  Practitioner insights, case experience,   ← This repo (public)  ⬜ IN PROGRESS
  real-world implementation notes
  (bridges Layer 1 theory → Layer 2 practice)

Layer 2: Operational Frameworks              .claude/skills/_shared/
  Templates, decision frameworks,            ← This repo (public)  ⬜ TO BUILD
  checklists, reference tables

Layer 3: Site-Specific Documents             ~/Amaran-Site-Knowledge/
  Desensitized SOPs, WIs,                   ← Separate private repo ⬜ IN PROGRESS
  IQ/OQ/PQ reports, validation reports
```

**Why separate repos for Layer 3:** This repo is public. Site SOPs contain proprietary process logic and may reflect client product information. Even after desensitization, the document structure itself carries IP risk. Layer 3 lives in a private repo, read locally by skills.

## Education Layer — Document Discovery & Learning Tools ✅ COMPLETE

Three browser-based tools provide document discovery, role-based learning, and knowledge visualization. All data is driven by `reports.json` and `gmp-curriculum-data.js` — no hardcoded content.

### index.html — Document Index Dashboard

Bilingual (EN/ZH-TW) searchable document index with deep search across titles, summaries, and section content.

- Source-based filtering (PDA, ISPE, FDA, ICH, PIC/S, USP, ISO, Ph.Eur.)
- Tag-based filtering with color-coded topic pills
- Reading history with localStorage persistence
- Relevance scoring with per-field match badges
- Sort by relevance, date, or source
- Links to: `learning-path.html`, `mindmap.html`, `quiz.html`

### learning-path.html — Department Curriculum Tracker

Role-based reading tracker powered by `gmp-curriculum-data.js`. Covers 8 departments × 3 tiers.

| Department | Icon | Tier 1 Foundation | Tier 2 Core | Tier 3 Advanced |
|-----------|------|-------------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Quality Assurance | 🛡️ | 5 docs | 8 docs | 4 docs |
| Quality Control | 🔬 | 7 docs | 16 docs | 12 docs |
| Manufacturing / Production | ⚙️ | 5 docs | 7 docs | 6 docs |
| Engineering & Maintenance | 🔧 | 5 docs | 6 docs | 5 docs |
| Regulatory Affairs | 📋 | 5 docs | 6 docs | 5 docs |
| Warehouse | 🏗️ | 5 docs | 6 docs | 4 docs |
| Technical Service | 🛠️ | 5 docs | 7 docs | 5 docs |
| Biotechnology IT (BT) | 💻 | 5 docs | 6 docs | 5 docs |

Features: checkbox progress tracking, Required/Optional badges, per-department progress rings, overall completion percentage — all persisted in localStorage. Quiz score badges (🎯 95%) appear on each doc row when a quiz has been attempted.

### quiz.html — Quiz Score Tracker

Browser-based quiz history dashboard. Stores exam results in localStorage (`gmp-quiz-results`). Receives results via paste-JSON workflow from Claude Code `/quiz` skill.

| Tab | Function |
|-----|----------|
| Quiz History | All attempts grouped by doc_key, with per-question breakdown and color-coded score pills |
| Record Result | Paste JSON output from Claude → validate → save to localStorage |
| How to Use | Step-by-step instructions |

Score tiers: ≥80% = green, 60–79% = yellow, <60% = red.

### /quiz Skill — Interactive Exam Conductor

Claude Code slash command (`.claude/commands/quiz.md`). Accepts a doc key or topic path:

```
/quiz TR22
/quiz topics/APS-filling-isolator
/quiz PICS-Annex15
```

Workflow: resolve doc → read knowledge MD (or exam bank JSON from `knowledge/exams/`) → silently design 10 questions → ask one at a time → score each answer immediately → output final JSON block for pasting into `quiz.html`.

Question bank directory: `knowledge/exams/` — pre-written questions in JSON format for repeatability. First bank: `topics-APS-filling-isolator.json` (10 questions, derived from live exam 2026-04-10, score 95/100).

### mindmap.html — Knowledge Mind Map

Interactive D3.js + Markmap-powered visualization of the entire knowledge base. Three view modes:

| View | Description |
|------|-------------|
| By Department | Shows 8 department tracks with Foundation → Core → Advanced hierarchy |
| By Topic | Groups documents into 10 thematic clusters (Aseptic Processing, Sterilization & Filtration, Container Closure, Quality Systems, Environmental Monitoring, Testing Methods, Facilities & Utilities, Advanced Therapies, Regulatory & Compliance, Emerging Technologies) |
| By Source | Organizes all 167 documents by issuing organization (PDA, ISPE, FDA, ICH, PIC/S, USP, ISO, Ph.Eur.) |

### gmp-curriculum-data.js — Curriculum Data File

Single source of truth for learning path structure. Consumed by `learning-path.html` and `mindmap.html`.

- `departments[]` — 8 department objects (QA, QC, Production, Engineering, RA, Warehouse, Technical Service, BT/IT), each with `tiers[]` containing curated `docs[]` (key + required flag + rationale)
- `topicClusters[]` — 10 topic clusters with tag-based matching for mind-map "By Topic" view
- `sourceOrgs{}` — 8 source organization labels and brand colors
- Helper functions: `generateDeptMarkdown()`, `generateTopicMarkdown()`, `generateSourceMarkdown()` (used by Markmap renderer)

## Expert Knowledge Base — Practitioner Layer

> **Session note — 2026-04-07:** This layer was planned to capture David Kuo's 10 years of sterile manufacturing experience as a structured knowledge layer. It sits alongside Layer 1 (regulatory reference) as interpretive, experiential content — the "what it actually means in practice" companion to official guidelines.

### What This Layer Is

Layer 1 documents what regulations *say*. This layer documents what a practitioner *knows from doing it* — the failure modes, judgment calls, shortcuts that backfire, and decisions that aren't documented anywhere. Knowledge of this type is:
- Tacit (in someone's head, not in any guideline)
- Rare (very few people have the same cross-functional exposure)
- Perishable (gets lost when people move on or organizations change)
- High-leverage (saves weeks of trial and error for the next person)

### Practitioner Background — David Kuo

| Period | Role | Organization | Key Domain |
|--------|------|-------------|------------|
| 2014–2016 | Assistant Scientist | TWi Pharmaceuticals | Parenteral lyo ANDA formulation development |
| 2016–2018 | Manager | Noratech Pharmaceuticals | US ANDA tech transfer, CMO/CRO management, CTD filing → FDA approval |
| 2018–2019 | Production Specialist | Pfizer | Aseptic processing (antibiotic injectables), deviation handling |
| 2019–2021 | Senior Technology Development Specialist | Amaran Biotech | DP line expansion (conceptual → construction → C&Q), DS scale-up tech transfer |
| 2021–2025 | Assistant Manufacturing Manager | Amaran Biotech | Vanrx SA25 robotic filling (full lifecycle), VPHP validation, APS, new format integration |
| 2025–now | Plant Operations Director | Amaran Biotech | 4-dept CDMO operations, 6 customer tech transfers, AI integration into GMP ops |

**Proof points:**
- ANDA 211463 — US FDA approved 2019-09-13 (parenteral lyo + diluent, first end-to-end ANDA managed as PM)
- Vanrx SA25 — virtual installation through annual requalification, VPHP cycle dev & validation, new format integration
- DP line built from zero — HAZOP, value engineering, construction supervision, C&Q completion
- 6 customer products — 100% on-spec commercial batches delivered on schedule as CDMO

### Ownable Knowledge Areas (Priority-Ranked)

These are topics where David's experience is rare enough to constitute a knowledge moat — few practitioners have documented these from direct execution, and no public regulatory document covers the "how it actually went" dimension.

| Priority | Topic | Why It's Ownable | Target File |
|----------|-------|-----------------|-------------|
| **#1** | Vanrx SA25 robotic aseptic filling — full lifecycle | Few SA25 sites globally; no public case documentation for virtual install → VPHP → APS → new format integration as a continuous narrative | `knowledge/EXPERT/vanrx-SA25-lifecycle.md` |
| **#2** | Lyo ANDA end-to-end: bench → FDA approval | Formulation dev (TWi) + tech transfer + CMO mgmt + full CTD authorship + FDA discipline review response + approval — entire arc owned, ANDA 211463 as evidence | `knowledge/EXPERT/lyo-ANDA-end-to-end.md` |
| **#3** | AI in GMP operations — live implementation | Deviation report agent, change control agent, BD evaluation tool — already running in GMP environment 2025; regulatory frameworks haven't caught up yet | `knowledge/EXPERT/ai-in-gmp-operations.md` |
| **#4** | CDMO DP line: zero to commercial | Facility expansion (HAZOP to construction) → C&Q → first commercial batches for external clients — the "build and run" perspective | `knowledge/EXPERT/cdmo-line-build-to-commercial.md` |
| **#5** | Sponsor ↔ CMO dual perspective | Managed CMOs as sponsor (Noratech); operated as CMO being managed (Amaran) — rare bilateral view of tech transfer negotiations, audit dynamics, quality agreements | `knowledge/EXPERT/sponsor-cmo-bilateral-view.md` |
| **#6** | VPHP cycle development & validation | Cycle parameter rationale, failure modes, bioindicator placement — minimal public documentation on the decision process behind validated cycles | `knowledge/EXPERT/vphp-cycle-development.md` |
| **#7** | Aseptic filling deviation patterns | 23 deviation reports written at Pfizer + ongoing CDMO deviation handling — pattern recognition across deviation types, investigation pitfalls, CAPA design | `knowledge/EXPERT/aseptic-deviation-patterns.md` |
| **#8** | US ANDA CTD authorship (parenteral) | Sections 2.3.P, 3.2.P.2/3/7/8, M1 (labeling/packaging) — practical authorship decisions, FDA discipline review letter dynamics | `knowledge/EXPERT/anda-ctd-authorship.md` |
| **#9** | CDMO business operations | Cost reduction (IPC frequency, RTP bags, filter redesign — 15–20% savings), energy load-shedding, BD at exhibitions, client audit preparation | `knowledge/EXPERT/cdmo-operations-economics.md` |

### Capture Method

Each file will be built using one of three inputs — whichever is available:

| Input Type | Method |
|-----------|--------|
| Existing Word/PDF documents | Extract + restructure into knowledge MD format |
| Partial notes + recall | Structured interview (topic-by-topic guided Q&A) |
| Pure recall | Guided oral dictation with follow-up questions |

**Format:** Each knowledge MD uses the same conventions as `knowledge/PDA/*.md` and `knowledge/ISPE/*.md` — but content is original practitioner knowledge, not extracted from a regulatory document. Source attribution: `Source: David Kuo, direct experience [year range]`.

### Status

| File | Status | Input Available |
|------|--------|----------------|
| `vanrx-SA25-lifecycle.md` | ⬜ Not started | Recall + possible internal docs |
| `lyo-ANDA-end-to-end.md` | ⬜ Not started | Recall (ANDA 211463 as anchor) |

## Layer 2: Operational Frameworks

### Operational MD Files to Build (~27 files)

| Type | Files | Used by |
|------|-------|---------|
| Output templates | deviation report, CAPA, OOS worksheet, CC form, SOP structure, PQR chapter, FMEA, IQ/OQ/PQ scope, tech transfer checklist, supplier audit | All major skills |
| Decision frameworks | deviation classification, change classification, batch disposition, HBEL/MACO calc, GAMP category, supplier type matrix | deviation, change-control, batch-release, hbel-screen, csv-plan |
| Checklists | EM excursion response, inspection filling area, inspection QC lab, inspection warehouse, client audit data room, tech transfer 6-stage | em-excursion, inspection-prep, client-audit, tech-transfer |
| Reference tables | Annex 1 section map, FDA 483 common observations, validation trigger matrix, DI 9-Box framework, CPV statistical guide | annex1-check, inspection-prep, validation-xref, di-check, cpv-review |

### Skills System — 26 Slash Commands

See `SKILLS.md` for the full skill list with usage scenarios, initiating departments, and QA roles.

**Build priority:**

| Priority | Skills | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| P0 | `/deviation`, `/change-control` | Highest daily frequency |
| P1 | `/em-excursion`, `/sop-new`, `/sop-revision`, `/annex1-check`, `/inspection-prep`, `/client-audit`, `/oos-investigate`, `/cc-sop-impact` | Core quality system activities |
| P2 | `/complaint`, `/reg-gap`, `/di-check`, `/pqr-framework`, `/feasibility`, `/hbel-screen`, `/bd-qa`, `/batch-release`, `/training-content`, `/csv-plan` | Periodic or scenario-specific |
| P3 | `/cpv-review`, `/tech-transfer`, `/qualification-plan`, `/validation-xref`, `/risk-assess`, `/supplier-qual` | Project-level or complex |

**Skills with supporting files use a folder structure:**

```
.claude/skills/
├── _shared/               ← cross-skill templates and frameworks
├── deviation/
│   ├── deviation.md       ← skill prompt (the slash command)
│   ├── template-deviation-report.md
│   └── template-capa.md
├── change-control/
│   ├── change-control.md
│   ├── template-cc-form.md
│   └── framework-change-classification.md
└── gmp-ask.md             ← simple skills: single file, no folder
```

**Bottlenecks:**
- Skills iteration — first version always needs 2–3 real-case test cycles before stable

---

## Layer 3: Site-Specific Documents

Layer 3 is fed by the Amaran AI SOP project (`~/Amaran-AI-SOP/`), which already has:
- `sop_to_markdown.py` — SOP → Markdown conversion (v3.7)
- `amaran_redact.py` — desensitization script
- 9 pilot SOPs converted and verified

**Human review is required for every desensitized document before it enters Layer 3.** This step cannot be automated (~20 min/SOP).

---

## Low Priority / Market-Specific Sources

Add only when client mix justifies:

| Source | Scope | When to Add |
|--------|-------|------------|
| **PMDA + JP** | Japanese regulatory guidance + Japanese Pharmacopoeia | If Japan MAA clients increase |
| **NMPA + ChP** | China GMP + Chinese Pharmacopoeia | If China market entry planned |
| **EMA product-specific** | Biologics, lyophilization, ATMP guidelines | When ATMP or EU biologics clients onboard |
| **ICH Q5 series** | Q5A–E: viral safety, stability for biologics | If biologics API clients increase |
| **ICH Q11** | Drug substance development | When regulatory submission support expands |

> **ICH scope note:** Q8/Q9/Q10/Q12/Q13/Q14 are included in this hub (analytical + manufacturing lifecycle). The full ICH set (Q1–Q7, Q11, S-series, E-series, M-series) is not sterile-manufacturing-specific.

> **IEC scope note:** IEC 62366-1 is included only for combination product human factors validation. Other IEC standards are out of scope.

## Documents NOT in Scope

| Document | Why Excluded |
|----------|-------------|
| ICH Q1–Q7, Q11 | General pharma chemistry / drug substance — not sterile-manufacturing-specific |
| ICH S-series, E-series, M-series | Safety, efficacy, multidisciplinary — not manufacturing-focused |
| ASTM standards | ASTM E2500 (verification) is influential but too niche for this hub |
| ISO 11135 (EtO sterilization) | Rarely used for sterile injectables |
| ISO 11137 (Radiation sterilization) | Niche; for devices not primary pharma injectables |
| ISO 11608-4/5 (Electronic/automated injection systems) | Advanced device electronics — out of scope |
| ISO 11608-4/5 only (Electronic/automated injection systems) | Advanced device electronics — out of scope (ISO 11608-1/3 in Phase 5) |
| IEC standards other than 62366-1 | Electrical safety, EMC, cybersecurity — outside GMP scope |
| Full PDA TR catalog | Many TRs cover non-sterile topics. Only sterile-relevant TRs included |
| BP (British Pharmacopoeia) | ~95% harmonized with Ph. Eur. post-Brexit. Add Ph. Eur. first |
| ChP (Chinese Pharmacopoeia) | Add only if China in-market manufacturing is in scope |
| ANVISA / LatAm regulations | Region-specific; add only if Latin America supply is strategic |
